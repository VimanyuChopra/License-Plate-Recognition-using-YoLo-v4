# License-Plate-Recognition-using-YoLo-v4
The aim of this project is to develop a system that
performs the task of detecting and recognizing vehicle license
plates implemented on Raspberry pi which has a camera
module attached to it, capable of capturing images.It involves
capturing images, building a deep learning model, and training
it to get weights that are used to detect real-life objects (in our
case -vehicle license plates). Furthermore, the images are taken
from different angles so it would require the prediction model to
be robust and adapt to different scenarios/conditions
